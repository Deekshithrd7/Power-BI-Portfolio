This is a Project provide key isights in important parts of the business in a assumed company named AtliQ Hardware.

I have built finance,Sales,Marketing and Supply Chain Dashboards using a real time modified.

The purpose of this project is to analyse,transform, model and visualize the raw data in to meaningful insights which provides valuable business intelligence for AtliQ hardware to take effective business decisions.

I have used various measures, KPI and metrics to visualize in every dashboard. Designed the dashboard report in a user friendly manner by using right visuals, colour and alignment.

This dashboard can help the ceo or any managerial employee to improve the revenue of the underperforming customers in some of the regions around the world.Also It helps the supply chain management team to precisely forecast the goods or raw materials. Moreover,By consuming the insights from the marketing dashboard the marketing team can identify trends in the market there by improving their marketing startegies for effective customer retention and new customer acquisition.
